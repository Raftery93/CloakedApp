### Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

### Motivation

This program was developed as a project for the Module 'Graph Theory'.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing Required Softwares



A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Example Use

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
